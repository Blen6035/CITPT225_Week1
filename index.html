         <p>Fun facts are never "fun" but let's see what you think of these. I have a black belt in karate, but it's been 9 years since I trained. I have read the Harry Potter series over 20 times. I don't like peanut butter.</p>

          <h1>it's <b>nice</b> to meet you</h1>
          <p>I'm Amanda and I make pretty things. Whether it's graphic design, websites, or arts and crafts, I just like to create. I don't have any children but I do have one dog named Ranger that my husband and I spoil rotten. He can be very dramatic and picky. He is the only dog I know that doesn't like people food and will turn his nose up at a treat.</p>
